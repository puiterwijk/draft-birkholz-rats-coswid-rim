     Reference Integrity Measurement Extension for Concise Software
                               Identities
                 draft-birkholz-rats-coswid-rim-latest

Abstract

   Concise Software Identification (CoSWID) tags identify and describe
   individual software components, patches, and installation bundles.
   CoSWID is based on ISO/IEC 19770-2:2015 2:2015 that provides a
   complementary XML schema definition (XSD) for Software Identification
   (SWID) tags.  CoSWID supports the same features as the corresponding
   XML SWID tags.  The CoSWID specification also includes more
   structured extensibility features and reduces a few of ambiguities
   that are not explicitly resolved in the ISO SXD.  In this document,
   these extensibility features (extension points) are used to add
   attributes to the CoSWID specification.  The new attributes allow for
   the use of CoSWID as Reference Integrity Measurements (RIM).  There
   are three set of RIM features defined in this specification. 1.)
   attributes that support RIM manifests for Measured Boot, 2.)
   attributes that support the RPM package manager structure, and 3.)
   attributes that allow for OID to be used in the description of
   Reference Integrity Measurements.

1.  Introduction

   Reference Integrity Measurements describe the intended state of
   (composite) software components installed on a (composite) device.  A
   measurement of all installed software components of a devices allows
   for assertions about the trustworthiness of the given device.  In
   combination with a root of trust (RoT) for reporting (RTM), these
   measurements can be refined into evidence and enable IETF Remote
   Attestation Procedures (RATS).  RATS support the decision process of
   whether to put trust in the trustworthiness of a device - or not.

   The RATS architecture [I-D.ietf-rats-architecture] defines the roles
   Verifiers, Attesters, Endorsers, and Relying Parties.  The RATS
   architecture also specifies that Attestation Evidence is created by
   Attesters and consumed by Verifiers.  Ultimately, the goal is to
   enable a Relying Party to put trust in the trustworthiness of a
   remote peer (the Attester).  Attestation Evidence is composed of
   believable assertions about an Attester's trustworthiness
   characteristics.  In RATS, these assertions are called Claims.  The
   Verifier conducts a set of appraisal procedures in order to assess
   the compliance of an Attester's trustworthiness characteristics.

   The most prominent appraisal procedure in RATS is the comparison of
   Claim values included in Attestation Evidence with Reference Claim
   values provided by Endorsers (e.g. supply chain entities).  The
   comparison of Claim values via Reference Claim values is vital for
   the assessment of compliance metrics with respect to software
   components installed on an Attester.  A typical objective here is the
   remediation of already vulnerabilities discovered in certain versions
   of software components.

   The Integrity Measurement Architecture (IMA) of the Linux Security
   Modules (LSM) provides a detailed Event Log (sometimes also referred
   to as a Measurement Log) that retains a sequence of hash measurements
   of every software sub-component (e.g. a firmware, an ELF executable,
   or a configuration file) that is created and appended to the sequence
   of measurements that composes the event log before the software
   component in question is started or read.

   In essence, to enable this appraisal procedure conducted by Verfiers
   an Attester's IMA provides Event Logs that include the hash values of
   every started software component and therefore are part of the
   Attestation Evidence an Attester creates.  The complementary well-
   known-values that Verifiers require are included in the Reference
   Integrity Measurements (RIM).  RIMs can be provided via Software
   Identification tags created by Endorsers, such as the software
   creators, manufacturers, vendors, or other trusted third parties
   (e.g. supply chain or certification entities).

Internet-Draft                 CoSWID RIM                  February 2020


   This document provides an extension to the CoSWID specification
   defined in RFC XXXX.  The extension adds attributes to CoSWID tags
   that enable them to express RIMs.  A vital subset of these attributes
   are illustrated in the TCG Reference Integrity Manifest Information
   Model [ref] specification.  These attributes are added to the
   existing CoSWID specification via the most general extension point
   the CoSWID specification provides: $$coswid-extensions.  An
   additional map definition named "reference-measurements" is added and
   is defined in section [ref] of this document.

   Furthermore, a usage profile for signed CoSWID tags is defined that
   supports the software-component structure of the RPM packet
   management system [ref].  Signed CoSWID tags that are aligned with
   that software m

   Reference Integrity Measurements provide a vital resource to be
   consumed by

1.1.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  CoSWID Attribute Extensions

   This specification defines three types of attribute sets that can be
   added to the CoSWID specification via its defined extension points.

   1.  Attributes that support RIM manifests for Measured Boot (often
       still referred to as Secure Boot),

   2.  Attributes that support the RPM package manager structure, and

   3.  Attributes that allow for OID to be used in the description of
       Reference Integrity Measurements.

2.1.  RIM extensions for Measured Boot

   The following attributes are derived from the TCG Reference Integrity
   Manifest Information Model [ref] specification.  These attributes
   support the creation of relatively small CoSWID tags that enable the
   Remote Integrity Verification (RIV
   [I-D.fedorkow-rats-network-device-attestation]) of small things
   (constrained devices in constrained network environments).
