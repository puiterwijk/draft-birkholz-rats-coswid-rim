Abstract

   Concise Software Identification (CoSWID) tags identify and describe
   individual software components, patches, and installation bundles.
   CoSWID is based on ISO/IEC 19770-2:2015 2:2015 that provides a
   complementary XML schema definition (XSD) for Software Identification
   (SWID) tags.  CoSWID supports the same features as the corresponding
   XML SWID tags.  The CoSWID specification also includes more
   structured extensibility features and reduces a few of ambiguities
   that are not explicitly resolved in the ISO XSD.  In this document,
   these extensibility features (extension points) are used to add
   attributes to the CoSWID specification.  The new attributes allow for
   the use of CoSWID as Reference Integrity Measurements (RIM).  There
   are three set of RIM features defined in this specification. 1.)
   attributes that support RIM manifests for Measured Boot, 2.)
   attributes that support the RPM package manager structure, and 3.)
   attributes that allow for OID to be used in the description of
   Reference Integrity Measurements.

1.  Introduction

   Reference Integrity Measurements describe the intended state of
   (composite) software components installed on a (composite) device.  A
   measurement of all installed software components of a devices allows
   for assertions about the trustworthiness of the given device.  In
   combination with a root of trust (RoT) for reporting (RTM), these
   measurements can be refined into evidence and enable IETF Remote
   Attestation ProcedureS (RATS).  RATS support the decision process of
   whether to put trust in the trustworthiness of a device - or not.

   The RATS architecture [I-D.ietf-rats-architecture] defines the roles
   Verifiers, Attesters, Endorsers, and Relying Parties.  The RATS
   architecture also specifies that Attestation Evidence is created by
   Attesters and consumed by Verifiers.  Ultimately, the goal is to
   enable a Relying Party to put trust in the trustworthiness of a
   remote peer (the Attester).  Attestation Evidence is composed of
   believable assertions about an Attester's trustworthiness
   characteristics.  In RATS, these assertions are called Claims.  The
   Verifier conducts a set of appraisal procedures in order to assess
   the compliance of an Attester's trustworthiness characteristics.

   The most prominent appraisal procedure in RATS is the comparison of
   Claim values included in Attestation Evidence with Reference Claim
   values provided by Endorsers (e.g. supply chain entities).  The
   comparison of Claim values via Reference Claim values is vital for
   the assessment of compliance metrics with respect to software
   components installed on an Attester.  A typical objective here is the
   remediation of already vulnerabilities discovered in certain versions
   of software components.

   The Integrity Measurement Architecture (IMA) of the Linux Security
   Modules (LSM) provides a detailed Event Log (sometimes also referred
   to as a Measurement Log) that retains a sequence of hash measurements
   of every software sub-component (e.g. a firmware, an ELF executable,
   or a configuration file) that is created and appended to the sequence
   of measurements that composes the event log before the software
   component in question is started or read.

   In essence, to enable this appraisal procedure conducted by Verfiers
   an Attester's IMA provides Event Logs that include the hash values of
   every started software component and therefore are part of the
   Attestation Evidence an Attester creates.  The complementary well-
   known-values that Verifiers require are included in the Reference
   Integrity Measurements (RIM).  RIMs can be provided via Software
   Identification tags created by Endorsers, such as the software
   creators, manufacturers, vendors, or other trusted third parties
   (e.g. supply chain or certification entities).

Internet-Draft                 CoSWID RIM                     March 2020


   This document provides an extension to the CoSWID specification
   defined in [I-D.ietf-sacm-coswid].  The extension adds attributes to
   CoSWID tags that enable them to express RIMs.  A vital subset of
   these attributes are illustrated in the TCG Reference Integrity
   Manifest Information Model [ref] specification.  These attributes are
   added to the existing CoSWID specification via the most general
   extension point the CoSWID specification provides: $$coswid-
   extensions.  An additional map definition named "reference-
   measurements" is added and is defined in section [ref] of this
   document.

   Furthermore, a usage profile for signed CoSWID tags is defined in
   this specification in support of the software-component structure of
   the RPM packet management system [ref].  Signed CoSWID tags that are
   aligned with that software m ... TBD

1.1.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  CoSWID Attribute Extensions

   This specification defines three types of attribute sets that can be
   added to the CoSWID specification via its defined extension points.

   1.  Attributes that support RIM manifests for Measured Boot (often
       still referred to as Secure Boot),

   2.  Attributes that support the RPM package manager structure, and

   3.  Attributes that allow for OID to be used in the description of
       Reference Integrity Measurements.

2.1.  RIM requirements on existing CoSWID attributes

   As defined by NIST IR 8060 [ref], there are required "Meta
   Attributes" for XML SWID tags that have to be included in a SWID tag
   in order to compose a valid SWID RIM.  In this section, these
   attributes are mapped to CoSWID attributes and corresponding
   requirements on attributes defined in the CoSWID specification to
   compose valid NIST IR 8060 signed Payload content in the Concise

   Software Identity Reference Integrity Measurement (CoSWID RIM)
   representation.

   The 'software-meta-entry' type defined in the CoSWID specification
   includes the optional members 'product', 'colloquial-version',
   'revision', and 'edition'.  These four members MUST be included in a
   CoSWID RIM in order to compose a valid Reference Integrity
   Measurement in alignment with NIST IR 8060.  Furthermore, the
   semantics of the text (tstr) typed values MUST convey content that
   allows for semantic interoperability in a given scope (e.g. an
   administrative domain).  The software-meta-entries provide vital
   support for steering decisions made by the RATS verifier role in
   order to enable discovery and matching of related or additional
   CoSWID RIM available to or discoverable by the verifier.

2.2.  RIM extensions for Measured Boot

   The following attributes are derived from the TCG Reference Integrity
   Manifest Information Model [ref] specification.  These attributes
   support the creation of very small CoSWID RIM tags that enable the
   Remote Integrity Verification (RIV
   [I-D.fedorkow-rats-network-device-attestation]) of small things, i.e.
   constrained devices in constrained network environments.  In
   consequence, the majority of the attributes listed in this section
   represent metadata about firmware and supply chain entities that
   provide firmware for a device (platform).  Analogously to the
   mandated software-meta-entries illustrated above, the attributes
   defined in the table below provide more context and enable steering
   decisions for the appraisal procedures of a Verifier.  Consecutively,
   RIM have to be managed and curated in a consistent manner so that
   there is no significant threshold for a Verifier to make use of them
   during an appraisal procedure.

   The design of the following attributes is motivated by the vast
   variety of identifier types used in production today, e.g.
   endorsement documents [I-D.ietf-rats-architecture] that are enrolled
   or on-boarded on the Attester itself.  It is vital to highlight that
   this variety can render semantic self-descriptiveness more difficult.
   Most importantly though: interoperability beats self-descriptiveness.
   A convergence towards a common identification scheme with respect to
   software components and its subset that is firmware is highly
   encouraged - alas not achieved at the time of creating this proposed
   standard.

2.3.  Additional Measurement Attributes for CoSWID

   [I-D.ietf-sacm-coswid] specifies a well-defined file hash structure
   for integrity measurements of individual files in a file-system.
   This documents extends this feature to all additional members of the
   resource-collection group: 'directory', 'resource', and 'process'.
   These new well-defined measurement options extend the scope of RIM to
   (sub-)trees of files, software running in memory (e.g. available from
   Trusted Execution Environments, such as SGX enclaves), and even
   external resources, such as remote services of collections of RIM
   bundles.
